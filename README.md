### Vase Carpet

This carpet overflows with naturalistically rendered flowers and plants,
organized around one central medallion and four quarter- medallions in
each corner. A similar medallion design can be seen on many decorative
leather book covers from the same period, and it is likely that the
manuscript design was incorporated into the visual repertoire of Safavid
weavers. Artists working in the court atelier produced drawings and
designs for artisans working in a variety of different media. The
designs and trends generated by the court were then adopted by
commercial workshops that created high-quality carpets like this one.
