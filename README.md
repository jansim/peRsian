Hi everyone, and welcome to our package “peRsian”!

peRsian is a tribute to centuries of Persian carpet-making — a craft
that’s been alive for over two thousand years. It’s dedicated to the
incredible artisans who’ve kept this tradition alive: especially the
women who spent countless hours knotting and weaving every single
thread, and the men who sheared the sheep, dyed the wool, and prepared
the yarn. Working in harmony, they transformed simple fibres into
carpets rich in colour, rhythm, and life.

We’ve extracted colour palettes straight from our personal galleries of
Persian carpets, rugs, and gabbehs, each paired with a small story of
its own. They capture rich reds, deep indigos, saffron golds, and all
those subtle shades in between.

Think of peRsian as a bridge between centuries of artistry and modern
data visualisation — a way to add warmth, history, and humanity to your
plots. Whether you’re visualising a multiverse, plotting microbiome
data, or just searching for a palette that feels alive, we hope peRsian
brings a bit of Persian magic to your work. 🌸

## ~~Palettes~~ Carpets

### Tehran

<img align="left" alt="Image of a Carpet feauturing vases filled with roses" src="man/figures/tehran.jpg" height="300">

A girl in hijab standing before a Persian carpet at the Carpet Museum of
Iran in Tehran (circa 2015). Much has changed since then. After months
of protests, the scarf weighs a little less now — though it’s not gone,
not yet — it remains a weight many women still carry. That change exists
because of the courage of countless Iranian women who have fought for
years to claim their freedom.

Woman, Life, Freedom. Jin, Jiyan, Azadî ✌️

### Pooran

<img align="left" alt="" src="man/figures/pooran.jpg" height="300">

From Namin, Ardabil, this kilim tells a world in threads — animals,
people, gestures, even the number of fingers carefully woven into each
form. Every scene hums with life: stories of work, play, and the quiet
beauty of tradition. Its details hold both the everyday and the eternal.
I dedicate it to my aunt Pooran, whose life was much the same — vivid,
full of movement and colour, bright with the small, human details that
made her unforgettable. — Yegi

### Fery 🐔

<img align="left" alt="Image of a carpet fragment repurposed as a cushion" src="man/figures/fery.jpg" height="300">

This vintage handwoven cushion brings new life to an antique wool rug
more than half a century old, carefully restored for continued use.
Persian weaving traditions are known for their durability and enduring
patterns.

Our very own “Fery Hahn 🐔” brought this beautiful carpet cushion all
the way from Shiraz to Munich, before it was carried even farther to New
Zealand, and now, this little piece has found its home in Melbourne!

### Leyli

<img align="left" alt="Photo of a large carpet draped in a museum, featuring a floral scene with dancing people" src="man/figures/leyli.jpg" height="300">

This carpet from the Tehran Carpet Museum feels like a celebration
frozen in time. It’s bursting with flowers, colour, and movement - birds
in flight, children playing the “daf” (an Iranian frame drum musical
instrument) and clapping, a man playing the “ney” (flute), and a woman
dancing gracefully at the centre.

It’s hard to tell if it’s a story, a dream, or a memory, but it feels
like joy woven into wool. A reminder that Persian carpets aren’t just
art; they’re music, dance, and moments of life itself, stitched together
in colour. 🎶

### Munich

<img align="left" alt="Image of a Carpet with a central Pattern" src="man/figures/munich.jpg" height="300">

What could be a good gift for my best friend as a keepsake from Iran?
Obviously, a handwoven Persian rug.

Gelim/Kilim (گلیم) is a traditional flat-woven rug made without pile,
crafted by nomadic and rural weavers across Iran. Persian gelims are
known for their bold geometric patterns, vivid natural dyes, and
practical lightness and durability — often used as floor coverings or
wall hangings.

A little piece of Shiraz is now living happily in his place in Munich. —

### Isfahan

<img align="left" alt="Image of a small carpet from Isfahan" src="man/figures/isfahan.jpg" height="300">

On a trip to Isfahan, Naeemeh and I wandered through Naqsh-e Jahan
Square — that magical place surrounded by little shops and bazaars, full
of colour and the smell of tea and saffron in the air. This tiny shop
caught our eye. Inside, tucked among all the treasures, we found the
smallest, most perfect little rug, a handwoven “gelim/kilim” (گلیم).

I was just about to move to Germany, and I needed something light, so I
could take it with me wherever I went. A small piece of home —
colourful, and full of memories. — Yegi

### Hamburg

<img align="left" alt="Image of the carpet bought in Hamburg" src="man/figures/hamburg.jpg" height="300">

Hamburg, March. A surprisingly windless, cloudy-grey kind of day —
basically, as good as it gets there. Wandering through the city’s tiny
side streets, suddenly Alex shouted, “Hey Yegi — a Persian carpet
store!” To our surprise, it turned out to be a huge shop tucked away on
the fifth floor of a building.

After nearly an hour exploring piles of carpets and rugs, a decision was
made: this was the one. On the train ride back to Munich, we spread it
out on one of the tables and played a deck of cards on it!!! It was a
memorable ride indeed.

### Hooshang

<img align="left" alt="" src="man/figures/hooshang.jpg" height="300">

Handwoven in Hamedan, western Iran, using handspun wool and all-natural
dyes. Among pictorial carpets, those depicting Hooshang Shahi hold a
special place. The story of Hooshang Shah — one of the earliest tales in
Ferdowsi’s Shahnameh — has long captured the imagination of weavers and
storytellers alike.

In the Avesta, his name appears as Heoshenge, with the epithet Pradetta,
meaning “lawmaker.” Hooshang is celebrated as the discoverer of fire and
founder of the Sadeh Festival, remembered as the ruler of the Seven
Countries, defeater of evil, and, in some traditions, the architect of
Persepolis.

### Tabriz

<img align="left" alt="" src="man/figures/tabriz.jpg" height="300">

This stunning carpet, called “The Four Seasons,” was woven in Tabriz,
one of Iran’s most renowned carpet-weaving cities. Its design tells the
story of the earth’s four seasons — spring, summer, autumn, and winter —
each woven into a corner with incredible detail and colour. There’s so
much happening in this piece — you can almost feel the shifting air, the
warmth of summer to the chill of winter. It’s as if the weavers captured
not just the seasons themselves, but how people feel in them — their
warmth, energy, and quiet moments of rest.

At the centre lies the Faravahar, the ancient Persian symbol associated
with light, wisdom, and freedom; “good thoughts, good words, good
deeds”.

### Abbas

<img align="left" alt="" src="man/figures/abbas.jpg" height="300">

At the centre sits Shah Abbas I, commonly known as Abbas the Great, the
Safavid ruler whose reign in the 17th century marked one of the
brightest chapters in Persian art and architecture. He’s remembered for
his vision, his patronage of artisans, and yes, that unmistakable
moustache!

### Reyhaneh

<img align="left" alt="" src="man/figures/reyhaneh.jpg" height="300">

This carpet is a perfect example of how Persian rugs bring soul, warmth,
colour, and life into the spaces we live in. In Iran, having carpets at
home feels so ordinary — they’re simply there, woven into everyday life.
And yet, it’s easy to forget how extraordinary they truly are. These
pieces carry stories, hands, and history — quietly grounding us,
softening our steps, and making any place feel like home.

### Berlin

<img align="left" alt="" src="man/figures/berlin.jpg" height="300">

It’s impossible not to pause and stare — the colours are so vibrant and
full of life they almost seem to breathe. This beauty now lives with our
friend in Berlin.

### Floral (Metropolitan Museum of Art)

<img align="left" alt="Image of a Floral Carpet" src="man/figures/floral.jpg" height="300">

This fragment of a carpet bears a variety of flowers on winding stems
over a blue ground. Its structure, which is composed of two planes of
warp threads, indicates that it was probably produced in the city of
Kirman in southeastern Iran. Carpets from this city display a wide range
of patterns but are alike in construction. Exported to India during the
reign of Emperor Akbar (r. 1556-1605), Kirman carpets were known to be
among the finest produced in Iran during this period.

This carpet is part of the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art:
