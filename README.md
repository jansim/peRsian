## ~Palettes~ Carpets

### Pattern

<img align="left" alt="Image of a Floral Carpet" src="man/figures/pattern.jpg" height="300">

A small quadratic carpet with a rich, traditional design. The piece
features a striking color palette dominated by deep navy blue, warm
golden yellow, and burgundy red, with accents of white and teal. The
central motif is a large, symmetrical medallion in navy blue that
resembles a stylized star or cross pattern. This central design is
outlined in white and burgundy and contains smaller geometric elements
within it. The medallion sits on a golden yellow background field.
Surrounding the central design is an ornate border system with multiple
bands. The main border features repeating geometric patterns in burgundy
red with cross-like motifs in various colors including white, teal, and
yellow. The border design shows the characteristic stepped or angular
patterns common in traditional carpet weaving.

### Vase

This carpet overflows with naturalistically rendered flowers and plants,
organized around one central medallion and four quarter- medallions in
each corner. A similar medallion design can be seen on many decorative
leather book covers from the same period, and it is likely that the
manuscript design was incorporated into the visual repertoire of Safavid
weavers. Artists working in the court atelier produced drawings and
designs for artisans working in a variety of different media. The
designs and trends generated by the court were then adopted by
commercial workshops that created high-quality carpets like this one.

### Floral

<img align="left" alt="Image of a Floral Carpet" src="man/figures/floral.jpg" height="300">

This fragment of a carpet bears a variety of flowers on winding stems
over a blue ground. Its structure, which is composed of two planes of
warp threads, indicates that it was probably produced in the city of
Kirman in southeastern Iran. Carpets from this city display a wide range
of patterns but are alike in construction. Exported to India during the
reign of Emperor Akbar (r. 1556-1605), Kirman carpets were known to be
among the finest produced in Iran during this period.
