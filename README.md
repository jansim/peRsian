## Palettes

### Vase

This carpet overflows with naturalistically rendered flowers and plants,
organized around one central medallion and four quarter- medallions in
each corner. A similar medallion design can be seen on many decorative
leather book covers from the same period, and it is likely that the
manuscript design was incorporated into the visual repertoire of Safavid
weavers. Artists working in the court atelier produced drawings and
designs for artisans working in a variety of different media. The
designs and trends generated by the court were then adopted by
commercial workshops that created high-quality carpets like this one.

### Floral

This fragment of a carpet bears a variety of flowers on winding stems
over a blue ground. Its structure, which is composed of two planes of
warp threads, indicates that it was probably produced in the city of
Kirman in southeastern Iran. Carpets from this city display a wide range
of patterns but are alike in construction. Exported to India during the
reign of Emperor Akbar (r. 1556-1605), Kirman carpets were known to be
among the finest produced in Iran during this period.
