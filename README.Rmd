### Vase

<img align="left" alt="Image of a Vase Carpet" src="man/figures/vase.jpg" height="300">

This carpet overflows with naturalistically rendered flowers and plants, organized around one central medallion and four quarter- medallions in each corner. A similar medallion design can be seen on many decorative leather book covers from the same period, and it is likely that the manuscript design was incorporated into the visual repertoire of Safavid weavers. Artists working in the court atelier produced drawings and designs for artisans working in a variety of different media. The designs and trends generated by the court were then adopted by commercial workshops that created high-quality carpets like this one.

### Floral

This fragment of a carpet bears a variety of flowers on winding stems over a blue ground. Its structure, which is composed of two planes of warp threads, indicates that it was probably produced in the city of Kirman in southeastern Iran. Carpets from this city display a wide range of patterns but are alike in construction. Exported to India during the reign of Emperor Akbar (r. 1556-1605), Kirman carpets were known to be among the finest produced in Iran during this period.
